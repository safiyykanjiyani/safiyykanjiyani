Hey there! My name is Safiyy and I am a recent graduate of Reed College with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

After completing my degree, I was excited to dive into the world of cybersecurity and begin using my skills to protect people and organizations from cyber threats. That's why I am thrilled to be starting my career as a Vulnerability Engineer at CSW, a leading cybersecurity firm.

At CSW, I have the opportunity to work with a talented team of security experts and use cutting-edge technologies to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities in our clients' systems. It's a challenging and rewarding role, and I am constantly learning and growing as a professional.

Outside of work, I enjoy staying up to date on the latest trends and developments in the tech industry, and I am always looking for new ways to expand my skillset. I am also a big fan of outdoor activities, such as hiking and rock climbing.

I am excited to see where my career at CSW takes me and to use my passion for technology and cybersecurity to make a positive impact in the world. ðŸŒŽ
