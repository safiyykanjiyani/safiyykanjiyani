ðŸŽ“ Hey there! My name is Safiyy and I am a recent graduate of Reed College with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.

ðŸ”’ After completing my degree, I was excited to dive into the world of cybersecurity and begin using my skills to protect people and organizations from cyber threats. That's why I am thrilled to be starting my career as a Vulnerability Engineer at CSW, a leading cybersecurity firm.

ðŸ’¡ At CSW, I have the opportunity to work with a talented team of security experts and use cutting-edge technologies to identify, assess, and mitigate vulnerabilities in our clients' systems. It's a challenging and rewarding role, and I am constantly learning and growing as a professional.

â™Ÿ Outside of work, I enjoy studying chess and writing screenplays. I tend to get inspired by watching many indie films. 

ðŸŒŽ I love to collaborate on things that improve the world so if you're interested, drop me a line.
